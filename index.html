<div>
  <p>Hi my name is Martin Sandoval, I'm a 26 year old from Houston Tx. As a Houston native I support all the professional sports teams in the city and enjoy going to see some games live at their stadiums.
    Other hobbies I have besides watching sports is reading, cooking and playing soccer. I fell like these hobbies are what made want change in careers. I've done manual labor where the work does take a toll 
    on the body but, I didn't take too much phyiscal damge as I olny worked in that type of enviorment for about 2 years. Then I worked some time as sales person but that didn't last becaues while I had the chrisma 
    and focus of a good salesman. What was my greates weakness in sales was not pressuring the customer is what they call and I agree with my manager that tried help me overcom that hurdle. However, I had this idea that instead of changing
    my personality I should work in something that fits my personality and thats when I saw an ad for fullstack coding bootcamp. I looked up YouTube vidoes about online bootcamps and after a quick overview this feels like a great career path for me.
